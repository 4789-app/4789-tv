## Supported devices and limits

Requires Android 9 / API 28 or later, or Android-based Fire OS 7 or later. It does not run on Vega OS,
Apple TV, Roku, Samsung Tizen or LG webOS. Codec, HDR and audio support depend on your TV and source.

Version 0.2.1 passed offline code, security, test and package checks. New physical TV playback,
upgrade, remote and layout checks remain untested. Stalker catch-up and verified per-title original
language classification are incomplete. Read [known limitations](CHANGELOG.md#known-limitations).

## Source code and build

The app is written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for TV. Playback uses Media3 ExoPlayer and FFmpeg
audio fallback. Room stores the library; Android Keystore protects saved settings and IPTV accounts.
The phone-cast control interface uses Kodi JSON-RPC with project-specific extensions.

## Verification, security and licenses

Release 0.2.1 provides an optimized, non-debuggable APK, first-party source, native source package, source provenance and
checksums. The APK is 28,047,079 bytes. A matching checksum verifies bytes; it does not prove every
runtime behavior or a reproducible native build.

```

The existing compatibility certificate has the Android Debug subject. Local-network receiver
ports are unauthenticated. HTTP IPTV services use their configured transport. Use a trusted home
network and read [TRUST.md](4789TV/TRUST.md) and [SECURITY.md](4789TV/SECURITY.md).
